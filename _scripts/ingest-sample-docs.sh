The Veteran served on active duty from January 2010 to January 2014.\n2. The Veteran served in Afghanistan from June 2011 to June 2012.\n3. The Veteran was exposed to combat operations and witnessed traumatic events during service.\n4. The Veteran was diagnosed with PTSD by a VA examiner in 2022.\n5. The Veterans PTSD is related to his military service.\n\nCONCLUSION OF LAW:\nThe criteria for service connection for PTSD have been met. 38 U.S.C. Â§ 1110; 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.303.\n\nREASONS AND BASES:\nThe Veterans service records show he served in Afghanistan during a period of active combat operations. His service personnel records document exposure to mortar attacks, IED explosions, and witnessing the death of fellow service members.\n\nThe Veterans lay statements describe symptoms consistent with PTSD, including nightmares, hypervigilance, and avoidance behaviors that began during service and have persisted.\n\nThe VA examiners opinion found that the Veterans PTSD is at least as likely as not related to his military service. The examiner noted the Veterans combat exposure and the temporal relationship between his symptoms and service.\n\nThe Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence supports service connection for PTSD. The Veterans combat service, documented traumatic exposures, and current diagnosis establish the required nexus between his condition and service.\n\nDECISION:\nService connection for posttraumatic stress disorder is granted.",

He also had a pre-existing diagnosis of depression that was not service-connected. The Veteran argued that his PTSD symptoms aggravated his depression, making it worse than it would have been without the PTSD.\n\nThe Board denied secondary service connection, finding that the depression was not related to service. The Board failed to consider the aggravation theory under 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.310.\n\nLEGAL ANALYSIS:\nUnder 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.310, a disability that is not otherwise service-connected may be service-connected on a secondary basis if it is aggravated by a service-connected disability.\n\nThe Court found that the Board failed to:\n1. Consider the aggravation theory\n2. Obtain a medical opinion on whether PTSD aggravated the depression\n3. Apply the correct legal standard for secondary service connection\n\nThe Court remanded the case to the Board with instructions to:\n1. Obtain a medical opinion on aggravation\n2. Consider all evidence of record\n3. Apply the correct legal standard\n\nDECISION:\nThe Court vacated the Boards decision and remanded for readjudication consistent with this opinion.",
