Below is information on the three different review options.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                            | [REDACTED]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                          | Higher-[REDACTED]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [REDACTED]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| [REDACTED] This?                              | A reviewer will determine whether new and relevant evidence changes the prior decision.                                                                                                                                                                                                            | An experienced claims adjudicator will review your decision using the same evidence VA considered in the prior decision. | A [REDACTED] Judge at the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) will review your decision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| [REDACTED] [REDACTED]                   | You are adding or identifying new and relevant evidence to support your claim that we did not previously consider.

Consult your decision notice for details on what options are available and where to send the request.\n\n## [REDACTED] with [REDACTED] Request:\n\nFor more information on all the available review options, contact us at 1-800-827-1000 or visit  www.va.gov/decisionreviews/.

Service connection for left hip condition with degenerative arthritis, other than posttraumatic.\n\nService connection for left hip condition with degenerative arthritis, other than post-traumatic has been established as directly related to military service. (38 CFR 3.303, 38 CFR 3.304)\n\nThe effective date of this grant is August 14, 2024. Service connection has been established from the day VA received your intent to file (ITF) a claim for compensation. When a claim of service connection is received more than one year after discharge from active duty, the effective date is the date VA receives the intent to file when a prescribed form is received within a year of the ITF. (38 CFR 3.155, 38 CFR 3.400)\n\nAn evaluation of 10 percent is assigned from August 14, 2024.\n\nWe have assigned a 10 percent evaluation for your left hip condition based on:\n\n- Painful motion of the hip. (38 CFR §4.59 allows consideration of functional loss due to painful motion to be rated to at least the minimum compensable rating for a particular joint. Since you demonstrate painful motion of the thigh at the hip, the minimum compensable evaluation of 10 percent is assigned.)\n\n## Additional symptom(s) include:\n\n- Flexion of the thigh beyond 45 degrees\n- [REDACTED]\n- [REDACTED]\n- [REDACTED]\n- [REDACTED] Rotation\n- [REDACTED] [REDACTED] provisions of 38 CFR §4.40 and §4.45 concerning functional loss due to pain, fatigue, weakness, or lack of endurance, incoordination, and flare-ups, as cited in DeLuca v. Brown and Mitchell v. Shinseki, have been considered and applied under 38 CFR §4.59.\n\nA higher evaluation of 20 percent is not warranted for limitation of flexion of the thigh unless the evidence shows:\n\n- Flexion of the thigh limited to 21-30 degrees. (38 CFR 4.71a)\n\n## 2. Service connection for right hip condition with degenerative arthritis, other than posttraumatic.\n\nService connection for right hip condition with degenerative arthritis, other than post-traumatic has been established as directly related to military service. (38 CFR 3.303, 38 CFR 3.304)\n\nThe effective date of this grant is August 14, 2024. Service connection has been established from the day VA received your intent to file (ITF) a claim for compensation.
