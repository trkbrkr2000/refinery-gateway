Service connection for left hip condition with degenerative arthritis, other than post**\n**traumatic.**\n\nService connection for left hip condition with degenerative arthritis, other than post-traumatic\nhas been established as directly related to military service. (38 CFR 3.303, 38 CFR 3.304)\n\nThe effective date of this grant is August 14, 2024. Service connection has been established from\nthe day VA received your intent to file (ITF) a claim for compensation. When a claim of service\nconnection is received more than one year after discharge from active duty, the effective date is\nthe date VA receives the intent to file when a prescribed form is received within a year of the\nITF. (38 CFR 3.155, 38 CFR 3.400)\n\nAn evaluation of 10 percent is assigned from August 14, 2024.\n\nWe have assigned a 10 percent evaluation for your left hip condition based on:\n\n- Painful motion of the hip. (38 CFR §4.59 allows consideration of functional loss due to painful\nmotion to be rated to at least the minimum compensable rating for a particular joint. Since you\ndemonstrate painful motion of the thigh at the hip, the minimum compensable evaluation of 10\npercent is assigned.)\n\nAdditional symptom(s) include:\n\n- Flexion of the thigh beyond 45 degrees\n\n- [REDACTED]\n\n- [REDACTED]\n\n- [REDACTED]\n\n- [REDACTED] Rotation\n\n- [REDACTED] [REDACTED] provisions of 38 CFR §4.40 and §4.45 concerning functional loss due to pain, fatigue,\nweakness, or lack of endurance, incoordination, and flare-ups, as cited in DeLuca v. Brown and\nMitchell v. Shinseki, have been considered and applied under 38 CFR §4.59.\n\nA higher evaluation of 20 percent is not warranted for limitation of flexion of the thigh unless the\nevidence shows:\n\n- Flexion of the thigh limited to 21-30 degrees. (38 CFR 4.71a)\n\n**-**\n**2.
