# VA Decision Letter Extraction - Testing Guide

## Overview

The VA Decision Letter extraction endpoint analyzes VA rating decision PDFs and extracts:
- ‚úÖ Veteran personal information (name, SSN last 4)
- ‚úÖ Combined disability ratings (current and historical)
- ‚úÖ Monthly payment amounts (current and historical)
- ‚úÖ Service-connected conditions with ratings
- ‚úÖ Decision and effective dates

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Make sure API is running

```bash
cd refinery-api
npm run start
```

You should see: `üöÄ Refinery API is running on: http://localhost:3001`

### 2. Test with a decision letter PDF

**Using the test script:**
```bash
./test-decision-extraction.sh ~/path/to/your-decision-letter.pdf
```

**Using curl directly:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/va-knowledge/extract-decision-info \
  -F "file=@/path/to/your-decision-letter.pdf" | jq '.'
```

## Supported Document Formats

The parser handles multiple VA letter formats:

### 1. **Rating Tables**
```
DISABILITIES                              RATING          STATUS
Post Traumatic Stress Disorder            70%             Service Connected
Tinnitus bilateral                        10%             Service Connected
```

### 2. **Combined Rating History Table**
```
Combined Rating Evaluation    Effective Date
70%                           Sep 9, 2019
90%                           Aug 14, 2024
```

### 3. **Monthly Payment Table**
```
Monthly Entitlement          Effective Date
$1,823.42                    Sep 9, 2019
$3,057.13                    May 12, 2025
```

### 4. **Narrative Descriptions**
```
Service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder is granted
with an evaluation of 70 percent effective September 9, 2019.

The evaluation for left hand strain is increased from 0 percent
to 10 percent effective May 12, 2025.
```

## Testing Tips

### Test with Sample Data

If you don't have a real decision letter, you can test with the health enrollment form:

```bash
cd refinery-api
./test-decision-extraction.sh current-test.pdf
```

(Note: This will extract data but it's not a rating decision letter, so results will be limited)

### Check Server Logs

Watch the server output for extraction details:

```bash
# In your server terminal, you'll see:
[extract-conditions] Found potential rating table
[extract-conditions] Extracted 3 conditions from table
[extract-rating-history] Found Combined Rating table
[extract-rating-history] Extracted 5 rating history entries
[extract-monthly-payment] Found Monthly Payment table
[extract-monthly-payment] Extracted 3 payment entries
```

### Verify Extraction Quality

Good signs:
- ‚úÖ `total_conditions` > 0
- ‚úÖ `combined_rating` is between 0-100
- ‚úÖ `rating_history` has multiple entries
- ‚úÖ `current_monthly_payment` is a reasonable dollar amount

Bad signs:
- ‚ùå `total_conditions` = 0 (parser didn't find any conditions)
- ‚ùå Very high condition count (>20) with weird names (over-matching)
- ‚ùå `combined_rating` = null (couldn't find rating)

## Utility Modules (For Developers)

The parsing logic is organized into modular utilities:

1. **[extract-veteran-info.ts](refinery-api/src/parsingUtilities/extract-veteran-info.ts)** - Name and SSN extraction
2. **[extract-dates.ts](refinery-api/src/parsingUtilities/extract-dates.ts)** - Decision and effective dates
3. **[extract-combined-rating.ts](refinery-api/src/parsingUtilities/extract-combined-rating.ts)** - Current combined rating
4. **[extract-rating-history.ts](refinery-api/src/parsingUtilities/extract-rating-history.ts)** - Rating history table
5. **[extract-monthly-payment.ts](refinery-api/src/parsingUtilities/extract-monthly-payment.ts)** - Payment history
6. **[extract-conditions.ts](refinery-api/src/parsingUtilities/extract-conditions.ts)** - Service-connected conditions

Each utility can be tested independently and improved without affecting others.

## Next Steps

### Improve Extraction Accuracy

1. **Add more test PDFs** - Collect various VA letter formats
2. **Tune regex patterns** - Adjust patterns in utilities to match edge cases
3. **Add validation** - Check extracted data makes sense (e.g., ratings add up correctly)

### Add Features

1. **Condition grouping** - Group by body system (musculoskeletal, mental health, etc.)
2. **Diagnostic codes** - Extract VA diagnostic codes (e.g., 9411 for PTSD)
3. **Dependency detection** - Identify spouse/dependent payments

### Deploy

Once testing is complete, the endpoint is ready for production use.

## Troubleshooting

### "Connection refused"
Make sure the API is running on port 3001:
```bash
cd refinery-api && npm run start
```

### "No PDF file provided"
Check your file path and make sure the file exists:
```bash
ls -lh /path/to/your-file.pdf
```

### "Failed to extract information"
Check server logs for detailed error messages. The PDF may be:
- Encrypted or password-protected
- Scanned image without OCR
- Corrupted or invalid PDF format

### Over-matching conditions
If you see 100+ conditions extracted, the patterns are too greedy. This happens with:
- Health enrollment forms (10-10EZ)
- Other non-rating decision letters

The parser is optimized for **VA disability rating decision letters**.
