**Health & Readiness:**
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /ready` - Readiness check

**Documents API:**
- `POST /api/v1/documents/upload` - Upload document (stub)
- `GET /api/v1/documents/:id` - Get document status
- `GET /api/v1/documents/:id/status` - SSE stream for real-time updates
- `POST /api/v1/documents/:id/analyze` - Trigger analysis (stub)
- `GET /api/v1/documents/:id/export` - Get export links (stub)

✅ **Features Working:**
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming progress updates
- In-memory document store
- Stub progress simulation (6 stages)
- CORS configured for development
- Fastify logging enabled

✅ **Tested & Verified:**
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3000/health
# ✓ Returns: {"status":"ok","service":"api-gateway","version":"0.1.0"}

# Upload document
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/documents/upload \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"filename":"test.pdf"}'
# ✓ Returns: {"documentId":"uuid","status":"queued"}

# Stream progress
curl -N http://localhost:3000/api/v1/documents/test-123/status
# ✓ SSE events streaming every 2 seconds
```

## Testing the Current State

### Start API Gateway:
```bash
cd api-gateway
npm run start:dev
```

### Test Endpoints:
```bash
# Health
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Upload (stub)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/documents/upload \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"filename":"test-decision.pdf"}'

# Get document
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/documents/{documentId}

# Stream SSE (watch progress)
curl -N http://localhost:3000/api/v1/documents/test-123/status
```

### Use Contracts Types:
```typescript
import { DecisionStructured, IssueAnalysis } from '@formready/contracts';

// Full type safety across all services!
```

## Key Achievements 🎉

1. **Contracts-First Design** - Single source of truth for all data shapes
2. **Type Safety** - Auto-generated TypeScript from JSON schemas
3. **SSE Working** - Real-time progress updates functional
4. **Fastify** - High-performance API gateway
5. **Clear Structure** - Each service has defined responsibilities
6. **Event-Driven** - Architecture ready for async workflows

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Fastify over Express** - Better performance, built-in logging
2. **SSE is straightforward** - RxJS Observable makes it easy
3. **Contracts package is gold** - Will save hours in integration
4. **Stub everything first** - Can test flow before real implementations
5. **NestJS generators** - Speed up boilerplate creation

---

## What's Working Right Now

✅ API Gateway responds to all 5 document endpoints
✅ SSE streams fake progress events
✅ Health checks return status
✅ TypeScript types generated from schemas
✅ CORS enabled for frontend development

## What's Next

🔨 Create 7 remaining service stubs
🔨 Wire Redis event bus
🔨 Test end-to-end stub flow
🔨 Deploy all services to Railway
🔨 **Complete Phase 0!**

Then move to Phase 1 where we make extraction, retrieval, and analysis *real*.

---

**Status:** ✅ **On track!** Making excellent progress on Phase 0.

**Velocity:** 2 services completed in ~1 hour. Remaining 7 services should take 10-15 hours total.

**Confidence:** High - clear path forward, no blockers.

Let's keep building! 🚀
